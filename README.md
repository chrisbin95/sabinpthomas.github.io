## How to Learn HTML

The basic HTML concepts include:

* Creating an HTML page
* Using classes to organize your page and tie in styles
* Using headings to denote importance
* Adding text using paragraphs
* Creating links so users can contact you

## What You'll Need

You'll need a GitHub account, Git installed locally, and a text editor to edit HTML. Use GitHub's [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/), which is free and very powerful. The [VS-CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor is another great tool for development.

## Live Demo

Here is a [working version of this project](https://sabinpthomas.github.io/). Its public and hosted in "https://sabinpthomas.github.io/" domain.

## Setup

Once you have cloned the forked repository, go into the directory containing the project and look for the `/src` directory. This is the directory where you will be making changes when you start following the step-by-step instructions. You can simply open those files in a text editor and get started.

You can always open the index.html file directly in your browser and work through the tasks below. You can also head over to the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) website and follow the instructions to install Node on your machine. Once you have Node installed, open your command line and follow these instructions:

```
cd {folder}
npm install
npm start
```

Running `npm start` should open a browser window pointing to `http://localhost:3000`. Now once you make changes to the files under the `/src` directory, your browser will refresh automatically, displaying the newest changes made to the files. This will save you the round trip of saving files and clicking refresh on your browser.


## Deploying

Putting site on GitHub pages is a bit different than some other projects because the code is all in the `/src` directory. Thereâ€™s a nifty way to push this directory to a GitHub branch, which allows you to use GitHub pages with it! Try running this Git command for this project:

```
git subtree push --prefix src origin gh-pages
```

This will push the `src` folder up to GitHub on the `gh-pages` branch. After that, you should be able to open up `http://username.github.io/{folder}`, where `username` is your GitHub username.
